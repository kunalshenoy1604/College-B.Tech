===========================< Part 6: Known Bugs >=========================

     Number of Known Bugs = <number>

<e.g.
	
     Exiting from MS-DOS Critical Errors
     --------------------------------------------------
     MS-DOS critical errors, such as attempting to assemble a file on
     a drive which does not exist or is empty, produce the "Abort, Retry
     or Fail?" error message.  Selecting "Abort" when running KeyboardTest 
     in MS-DOS may cause memory to be corrupted.  This problem does not 
     occur when running KeyboardTest in Windows.  To avoid this problem, 
     select "Retry" or "Fail", as appropriate.


     Expression Order in High-Level Conditionals
     --------------------------------------------------
     Comparisons in high-level conditionals cannot begin with a literal.
     For instance, this comparison causes an error:

	  .IF 1 == AX

     but this works properly:

	  .IF AX == 1
